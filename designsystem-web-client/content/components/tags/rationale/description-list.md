Previous versions of the tags component had shown examples of the tags listed using a [Description List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl) `<dl>`. Expert accessibility advice has recommended that the use of Description Lists should be restricted to lists of terms and their descriptions.

It is now recommended to use an [Unordered List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) `<ul>` and a heading to introduce the purpose of the list.
