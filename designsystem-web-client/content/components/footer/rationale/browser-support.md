heading: Aria role content info

In the `footer` element, we add a `role="contentinfo"` to support older browsers and screen readers that do not expose the `footer` as a landmark.

For example the screen reader does not [provide support](https://tink.uk/screen-reader-support-for-html5-sections/) to the `footer` element when using JAWS 14 and Internet explorer 9.
