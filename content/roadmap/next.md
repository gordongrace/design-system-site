## Next

Things we will be working on in the near future:

- Work with GovCMS team to ensure tight feedback loops between Design System and default GovCMS theme
- Expand template offerings to include [commonly-requested templates](https://community.digital.gov.au/c/designsystem/suggest-a-template) (for example, search engine result pages, entry/exit steps to multi-factor authentication)
