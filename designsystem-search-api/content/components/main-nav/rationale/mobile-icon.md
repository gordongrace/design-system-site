In mobile (small) device layouts, the main navigation uses an icon which represents the menu. This follows a common convention in mobile interface design.

**Hamburger?** The 3 bar icon used on mobile is often affectionately referred to in user interface design as a “Hamburger” or “Hamburger menu” due to its appearance.

Despite this convention, not all users know that a hamburger means "navigation" or "menu". **The icon should never be shown on its own** and must have accompanying text to avoid assumed understanding of the icon.
