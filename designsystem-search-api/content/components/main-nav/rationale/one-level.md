layout: component/rationale.js
heading: One level

The main navigation currently supports one level as a first-version solution. This was done intentionally to keep the component relatively simple, which reduced the complexity for development and accessibility.

For discussion around requirements for more levels see the [main navigation community topic](https://community.digital.gov.au/t/main-nav).
