heading: Three levels

Each level in the side nav needs to be easily visually identifiable as a new level. Beyond 3 levels, visual solutions quickly become too complex or drastically reduce the available line length for links.

After reviewing multiple government and private sector websites, it was found that the upper extent of complex navigation solutions tended to be around 5 levels. To avoid overly complex user interfaces the navigation is often split into groups.

The best examples of navigation for a user where:
- One level in a main menu
- Landing page containing a list of second level links
- Three levels in a side navigation, inlcuding:
  - Active state in main menu
  - Title in side navigation for second level
  - Breadcrumbs
