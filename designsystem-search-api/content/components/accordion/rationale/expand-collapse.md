Accordion elements on some websites collapse any open panels when another one is opened. This behaviour can seem unpredictable for some users, which is why our accordion component does not behave in that way.

The intent is to make sure that users have full control over what content remains visible to minimise possible confusion when content suddenly ‘disappears’ from view.
