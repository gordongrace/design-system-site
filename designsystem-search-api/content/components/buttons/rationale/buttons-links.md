Our buttons can be implemented as links ( `<a>` )  or as buttons ( `<button>` ). We provide the flexibility so users can make the most semantic markup possible. Using incorrect HTML in certain situations can cause [accessibility issues](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html).
